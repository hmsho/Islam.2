As the First Pillar of Islam, Shahadah is one of the most important and acts as your first submission to Islam and announcing your intention as a true follower. Reverts to Islam are also required to make Shahadah as their first act of joining the faith and this serves as an affirmation of their commitment to their faith.To make Shahadah, intent is important, and you must recite the declaration sincerely three times with intent in your heart and mind.

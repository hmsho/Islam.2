		Salah, also written as Salat, is the second Pillar of Islam and the act of obligatory daily prayer that is carried out five times a day at set times. The five prayer times fall between sunrise and midnight, although the times change depending on where you are in the world and the time of year, in line with the lunar calendar. The prayers in order are as follows;<br>
	
<br>- Fajr; dawn, before the sun has fully risen</br>
<br>- Zhuhr; midday, once the sun has passed the highest point</br><br>- Asr; late afternoon, and before the sun begins to set</br><br>- Maghrib; after sunset, once the sun dips below the horizon</br><br>- Isha; between sunset and midnight
<br>
</br>
Part of the ritual of Salah is purifying your physical self (ablution) in preparation for prayer, this is a cleaning ritual known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xS70Zn-jRk&ab_channel=GreenLaneMasjid" title="How to make wudu"><b>wudu</b></a> and is an important first step that also washes away minor sins.

		The term Sawm means to fast, which is where the month of Ramadan comes in. Fasting during the holy month of Ramadan is more than simply avoiding food. It is the practice of discipline and the abstaining of temptations and bad habits. From sunrise to sunset, able Muslims should avoid food and drink (including water), sexual activity, smoking and intoxication and any impure thoughts. Throughout Ramadan and the rest of the year, everyone should abstain from acts of evil and causing harm to oneself or others.

	<div class="zakat-body">
		Zakat literally means ‘to cleanse’ but is recognised by many as ‘charity’. In Islam, it is believed that Allah SWT has intentionally created different levels of wealth for each individual to test humanity and generosity amongst believers. Every year, Muslims pay a 2.5% share of their held wealth (cash, property, gold, and silver) over a certain threshold to charity to help those less fortunate than themselves.An important lesson of Zakat is the acknowledgeable that nothing we gain in this world is ever truly ours, it will not accompany us to the Hereafter, and it has no use to be buried with us. Rather than our wealth, it is our good deeds towards those who need help and support that will help us enter Jannah (Heaven) and this shouldn’t be forgotten.The belongings we have in this world are just that – material items - and these items provide no spiritual guidance. Instead, it is how we use the wealth and materials we have gained to help others that will enhance our journey to the Hereafter and help us to let go and turn away from greed.In addition to Zakat, it is also good to give to those in need whenever we can. Whether it is to help those overcoming worldly conflicts and emergencies or those suffering from poverty and hunger, each and every act of giving is greatly rewarded in Islam – be it in our today or in our Hereafter.Donate your Zakat with Muslim Aid and help our less fortunate Brothers and Sisters receive food, medication, education, and shelter.
